# game_of_life
Playground for the game of life based on John Conway's idea

Work in progress. Currently it works in Chrome, but IE has a problem due to unsupported method getContext.

What I want is to have a screen with the creatures and a list of rules definitions when can creature be born, when it can live and when it can die.

I do not know yet how I will make the definitions editable. Possibly I could do the following:

"Come to life if you have X neighbors"
"Die if you have Y neighbors"
